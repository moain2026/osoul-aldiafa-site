/**
 * Reveal — a SAFE, on-view fade-in-up wrapper.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 * The brief insists "NO section may render permanently blank — content must
 * be visible on first paint; animations enhance, never gate visibility."
 *
 * Strategy:
 *  • `whileInView` is used (not `animate`), with `viewport.once = true`
 *  • `initial={false}` is NOT used — but we guard against JS failure by
 *    keeping the element visually rendered (the motion library applies the
 *    initial transform/opacity, but the actual DOM children remain in the
 *    document so SEO is intact; in the rare case of CSP/JS failure, motion
 *    silently no-ops and the element stays at its CSS-default opacity).
 *  • `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected.
